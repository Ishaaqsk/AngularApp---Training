<h1>The Natural History of the Cat</h1>
<p class="para">The domestic cat species evolved from Middle Eastern wildcats (felix silvestris lybica) who, research
    suggests,
    adapted to living in close proximity to people. <br />
    The relationship between cats and people evolved over thousands of
    years. Only recently, when cat litter was invented in the 1950s, did keeping cats indoors become mainstream.</p>
